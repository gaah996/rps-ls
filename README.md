# Rock, paper, scissors Game

This small game is developed in plain JS. It allows you to play a rock, paper, scissors game against the computer.

The player wins one point for each round it beats the computer, and loses one point if the results turns to be the other way.

The player wins the game when having 10 points, or loses the game when having -10 points.

Good luck, and good play!

## Running the project

### Development enviroment

To run the project on development: clone the repository, and in the main folder run:

```yarn install && yarn start```

Of course, after the first run, you can run the app in development just by using:

```yarn start```

### Production enviroment

To run the project in production (build the app): clone the repository, and in the main folder run:

```yarn install && yarn build```

The build process will create a `dist` folder with the files you need to run the app. From there you can just open the index.html file in the browser or use some webserver solution :)
